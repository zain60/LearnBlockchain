In blockchain We store Data in form of **Transaction**,
How transations are added in blockchain?
lets say user A  sends a transaction , 
transaction will go to **unconfirmed  transaction pool**,
where **Miners** pick the transaction from Pool  and then  mine the transaction and then **validaters** will validate it 
and then it will be added to blockchian.
