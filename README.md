## Basics of Web Evolution:

- ## what was web 1.0 (Static web)
  
-- In Web 1.0, the internet mainly featured static web pages with minimal user interaction.
-- Information was provided by a single source, and users had no involvement in content creation or interaction.
-- It was a centralized system where one entity controlled the content, and users relied on this entity for information.
  

- ## what is  Web 2.0 (The Social Web):

Web 2.0 introduced dynamic, interactive websites where users could engage through comments, sharing, and content creation.
Social media platforms emerged, fostering user-generated content and collaboration.
While it enhanced user interaction, it remained centralized, with control held by organizations or individuals.

- ## what is  web 3.0 (decenterlized web)
  
- Web3.0 strives for decentralization by leveraging technologies like blockchain and peer-to-peer networks.
- It emphasizes trustless systems through smart contracts, reducing the need for intermediaries.
- Users gain control of their data and assets in a system that lacks a central authority, ensuring transparency and security. No single entity has exclusive control
-  everything is  trustless and secure.

## Summery

In essence, Web 1.0 was static and one-way, Web 2.0 added user interaction within a centralized framework, and Web3.0 is pioneering a decentralized, trustless system where users have full control over their data and assets, with no central authority dictating the rules.
